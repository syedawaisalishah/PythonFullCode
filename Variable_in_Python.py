#we use variable for data storing python are dynamic language so that why we not use datatype keyword like int if we store value
#we only enter variable name and value like name=12
#there are some rule for variable
#1, we not start variable name from number like 1number=12
#2, we  start variable name from underscore like _number=12
#3, we  start variable name   like nu1mber=12
#4, we not start variable name from number like 1number=12
#5, we  use semiclon in last of value but they are not important
#6 , we not start variable name from any character like $number=12
#7 we use snake case writing like one_number_four=10 in snake case we type all name small letter and space replace by uderscore
#8 we use camel case writing like oneNumberFour=12 in camel case we type first  name small then all first name character capital
name=12;
print(name)
name="awais";
print(name)
name='asim';
print(name)
first_name="asim" #snake case
print(first_name)
secondNameStart="asim" #camel case
print(secondNameStart)
